## Development Tools

- [YAML Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/) - used to validate `YAML` files
- [validate-yaml](https://onlineyamltools.com/validate-yaml) - another validator

## Environment Setup

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and run the following command from the `/docker` folder:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

Once running you can connect to the database on `127.0.0.1:3306` using the user `pihole` and pass `password` using something like [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/) to make things easier.
